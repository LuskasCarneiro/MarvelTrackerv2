## You are here

**Phase 0 — Foundations. In progress.**

Next action: install the Supabase and three.js dependency sets, write the design tokens,
then run the TMDB pipeline. Blocked on nothing.

### Phase status

| Phase | State |
|---|---|
| 0 — Foundations (repo, scaffold, CI, memory, deploy) | **in progress** |
| 1 — Catalogue (TMDB pipeline, 152 titles, DOM design) | not started |
| 2 — Accounts (Supabase auth, RLS, ratings) | not started |
| 3 — The shelf (three.js, material system) | not started |
| 4 — Polish (a11y, perf, SEO) | not started |

### Open items

- **Migrations need a way to reach Supabase.** No secret key or access token on this
  machine, and that is deliberate. Either the owner pastes the generated SQL into the
  Supabase SQL editor once, or adds `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` + `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` as
  GitHub Actions secrets so CI applies migrations and no credential sits locally.
- **Vercel env vars:** confirm `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are set in the Vercel dashboard. Nothing else is
  needed there — TMDB is build-time only and its output is committed.
- **The 152 curated notes are in European Portuguese** and the product is UK English. They
  are hand-written and genuinely good, so they get **translated with care, not
  regenerated**. Source: `~/Desktop/marvel-vault/index.html`, the `films` and `seriesItems`
  arrays.
- **3D spike not yet run.** Offered to the owner: render one Amaray case with real cover
  art to prove procedural geometry is good enough before Phase 3 is funded. Not yet
  approved or declined.

## Log

### 2026-08-09 — Phase 0 begun

- Owner settled the four open decisions: **UK English**, **public sign-up with rate
  limiting**, **private shelves**, and **design authority delegated to Claude**.
- Credentials supplied in `.env`: TMDB v3 key + v4 read token, Supabase URL + publishable
  key. Verified present by name; values never printed.
- Vercel already deploying from `main` → https://marvel-trackerv2.vercel.app
- Local folder attached to `origin/main`; the placeholder `HelloWorld` blob removed.
- Scaffolded **Next.js 16.3.0** / React 19.2.8 / Tailwind v4 / TypeScript strict.
  *The plan said Next 15; reality is 16, which has breaking changes. Its own `AGENTS.md`
  warns that its APIs differ from training data — read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/`
  before writing App Router code.*
- `.gitignore` written **before** the first commit. Verified with `git add --dry-run` that
  `.env` is blocked and `.env.example` is staged. (`git check-ignore -v` is misleading here:
  it exits 0 even when the matching rule is a negation — trust the dry-run instead.)
- Renamed TMDB vars from TMDB's dashboard labels (`API_KEY`, `API_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN`) to
  `TMDB_API_KEY` / `TMDB_READ_TOKEN`.
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md` project memory and this file.

### 2026-08-06 — Plan approved

- Took apart `press.stripe.com` rather than guessing: it is **three.js**, driven by a
  per-book JSON material block embedded in the HTML, using **`MeshPhongMaterial` with
  shader injection** (not PBR — `shininess` gives it away), with two bump layers, a foil
  map and geometry thickness carrying page count. Full teardown in `docs/PLAN.md` §1.
- Concept settled: the archive as a shelf of home-video releases that ages by era.
- Considered and **rejected generative AI for product assets** (Higgsfield and similar):
  the shelf needs seamlessly tiling textures with split normal/roughness channels and an
  equirectangular HDRI — format mismatches, not quality gaps. Poly Haven / ambientCG give
  those as CC0 for free. See `docs/PLAN.md` §6.
